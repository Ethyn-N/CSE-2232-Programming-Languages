# Programming Languages Portfolio - CSE2232

## Introduction

Welcome to my portfolio for the CSE2232: Programming Languages course. This repository showcases my journey through understanding different programming paradigms, language design, and implementation. The course has enabled me to explore various concepts such as syntax, semantics, control structures, and data types across languages like Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript. My projects range from basic language syntax demonstrations to complex implementations of programming concepts.

## Project Highlights

### 1. Directory Size Calculation (C, C++, Java)
- Implemented in C (`ean0354_lab01.c`), C++ (`ean0354_lab01.cpp`), and Java (`ean0354_lab01.java`).
- Each version calculates the total size of files in a directory and its subdirectories, demonstrating file I/O, recursion, and language-specific features.

### 2. Array Manipulations and Functional Programming (JavaScript)
- **Lab02 (`ean0354_lab02.js`)**: Explores array operations in JavaScript. The script performs tasks like creating arrays, generating multiples, filtering, and summing elements using functional programming techniques, currying, and closures.

### 3. Reverse Polish Notation Calculator (Python)
- **Lab03 (`ean0354_Lab03.py`)**: A Python script that calculates expressions in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN). Demonstrates stack usage, expression evaluation, and file handling.
- **Lab03 Extended Challenge (`ean0354_Lab03_EC.py`)**: Enhances the RPN calculator with modulo operation handling and algebraic to RPN expression conversion, showcasing complex algorithm implementation.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Multilingual Proficiency**: Demonstrated ability to adapt and apply programming concepts across C, C++, Java, JavaScript, and Python.
- **Algorithmic Thinking**: Developed and implemented algorithms for complex problem-solving in different programming paradigms.
- **Functional Programming**: Utilized advanced JavaScript concepts like currying and closures.
- **Data Structures**: Effectively used stacks and arrays for expression evaluation and data manipulation.

## Navigating This Repository

- Each file (e.g., `ean0354_lab01.c`, `ean0354_lab02.js`) corresponds to a project, demonstrating different facets of programming languages.
- The `input_RPN.txt` and `input_RPN_EC.txt` files are used in the Python RPN calculator projects.

## My Journey

Throughout this course, I've not only gained a deep understanding of diverse programming languages but also developed skills in analyzing and implementing complex programming constructs. My portfolio reflects my growth as a programmer and my adaptability to different coding paradigms and challenges.
